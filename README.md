3D World with Delphi and Firemonkey

This project is an example of creating a 3D virtual world with Delphi and Firemonkey.
The project was made under Delphi Tokyo 10.2.3 professional edition. You can use the free community edition of Delphi.

This project show :
 - how to use a heightmap;
 - day/night cycle;
 - the user can move and orient himself freely;
 - cloud simulation;

 - use a map;
 - use Firemonkey animations.

Next evloution will be collisions detections with the TMesh but I can not do it for the moment ...
